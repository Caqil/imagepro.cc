      tip1: "For subtle film grain effects, use Gaussian noise at 10-20% intensity",
      tip2: "Monochrome noise tends to look more like classic film grain",
      tip3: "Salt & Pepper noise at low levels (5-15%) can add interesting texture to solid areas",
      tip4: "Colored noise can add a unique aesthetic to images with limited color palettes",
      tip5: "Higher noise amounts (50%+) create more dramatic, stylized effects",

      basicTitle: "Basic Borders",

      tipsTitle: "Tips for Best Results",
      tip1: "Consider the content of your image when choosing border colors—complementary colors often work best",
      tip2: "For a clean, professional look, use moderate border widths (10-30px) and simple solid styles",
      tip3: "When creating photo frames, use white or off-white inner frames with darker outer borders",
      tip4: "Match border radius to the style of your image—square for formal or architectural photos, rounded for casual or personal images",
      tip5: "Use padding to give your image some breathing room within its border",
      tip6: "For social media posts, try vibrant gradient borders to catch attention",
